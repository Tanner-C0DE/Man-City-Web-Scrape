Hi! My name is Tanner. I am a graduate in Comp Sci. I studied a lot in coding, but I never get to do it at my current job. I am also a huge Man City fan. So, I wanted to create a place to share my projects for others to look at or collaborate with. 
Please let me know if there is anything that I should add to the current projects or projects you would like to do together!
